# I2P Chat AKA I2P Qt Messenger

## Project Status

Fully BROKEN: Unusable!

I need to find time to fix all.

## Features

 * The communication goes «directly over i2p» from client to client, no server is required.[1] Note: The connections to the so-called «seedless» servers were removed from this project ; see : https://github.com/nonlinear-chaos-order-etc-etal/i2pchat/issues/40 . —hypn.

## How to run it

You need to enable SAM in your router on <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/configclients">java i2p configclients page</a> or i2pd's i2pd.conf [sam] section to make I2P Chat work over your I2P router.

## Security measures

### Since version 0.3.1

When building this, make sure you do not define `DEBUGLOGGING`. If you do define it, the app will log debug info (which includes all chat messages) to `configdir/DebugLog.txt` if set `DebugLogging` to `true` in `General` group in the app's configuration. See `main.cpp` and `form_settingsgui.cpp` for more details on `DEBUGLOGGING`. All versions < 0.3.1 are affected by this and are less secure.
    
## Project status, news and history

### Project status

Now the development was resumed by Hypnosis-i2p and R4SAS, with a lot more folks as testers &amp; bugs+issues reporters.

### Current news

5 Jan, 2017: Original repo at http://git.repo.i2p/w/I2P-Messenger-QT.git was fully merged here.
  
### History

Past. Original developer of this messenger went away.

Present. Hypnosis is continuing his work and the work of I2P folks (of Echelon, KYTV et al); the work is being done in a very low priority mode.
