### Build instructions

```
sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qt5-default build-essential libqt5multimedia5 qtmultimedia5-dev libqt5svg5-dev
```

 * To prepare for compilation, run qmake:
   - Release: `qmake I2PChat.pro "CONFIG += release"`
   - Debug: `qmake I2PChat.pro "CONFIG += debug"`

 * To compile:
   - `make -j NUMBER_OF_PROCESSOR_CORES` e.g `make -j8`
   - or `make` to compile single-threaded


### Downloads (pre-built binaries)

* Latest Windows (Win32/64) build from: <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wipedlifepotato/i2pchat/build/artifacts">https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wipedlifepotato/i2pchat/build/artifacts</a>

### Running

On Linux, `make` creates `I2PChat` executable in the current folder. Run it with `./I2PChat`.

* You will need to enable the SAM application bridge in your router: for Java I2P via <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/configclients">Client Configuration</a> or for i2pd via i2pd.conf's [SAM] section.
* As of version 0.2.31, the DSA_SHA1 Signature type is no longer available. The recommended (and default) Signature Type is now: EdDSA_SHA512_Ed25519
* Select 'Online' from the dropdown menu on the main window. When you first go online, your unique address (Destination) will be created when connecting to SAM
* Your settings and contacts will be stored in `~/.i2pchat/` on Linux-based systems, or `%APPDATA%\Roaming\I2PChat\` on Windows
